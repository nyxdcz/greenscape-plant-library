# Greenscape Plant Library

A browser-based plant library, landscape database, project scheduling, quotation, BOQ, and costing tool created for **Greenscape Landscaping Services**.

The website helps organize plant information, prepare project plant lists, create landscape schedules and mood boards, calculate project quantities and costs, and generate project documents from one workspace.

## What's New

### Forced Maintenance Cache Refresh V2

Maintenance mode is now force-enabled for all visitors using a new uncached override file.

Changes:

- Confirms `enabled: true` in `assets/js/maintenance-config.js`.
- Adds `assets/js/maintenance-force.js`, which forces maintenance mode on even when a browser has cached the older disabled configuration.
- Loads the force script after the configuration file and before the maintenance controller.
- Changes the cache versions for `maintenance.css`, `maintenance-config.js`, `maintenance-force.js`, and `maintenance.js`.
- Forces browsers to request the new maintenance startup and read-only files after GitHub Pages redeploys.
- Keeps the maintenance startup screen, read-only browsing, blocked editing, and protected `localStorage` behavior.
- Updates `index.html`, `package.json`, `scripts/validate.mjs`, and `README.md`.
- Runs the complete repository quality checks before deployment.

To disable forced maintenance later:

1. Remove the `maintenance-force.js` script tag from `index.html`.
2. Change `enabled: true` to `enabled: false` in `assets/js/maintenance-config.js`.
3. Change the maintenance cache-version strings again.
4. Update `README.md` and deploy the change.

### Maintenance Startup and Read-Only Mode V1

The website now includes an optional maintenance startup page and read-only browsing mode.

Included behavior:

- Shows a branded maintenance startup page when maintenance mode is enabled.
- Allows visitors to continue into the website using **Open read-only website**.
- Keeps navigation, project viewing, plant details, searching, filtering, printing, exporting, and Help available.
- Disables editing, saving, adding, deleting, importing, restoring, and other data-changing controls.
- Blocks browser `localStorage` writes while maintenance mode is active, protecting existing plant, project, quotation, BOQ, and costing records.
- Shows a persistent **Maintenance mode — Read-only access** banner.
- Provides clear disabled-control states and a message when a blocked action is attempted.
- Supports desktop, tablet, mobile, keyboard navigation, and reduced-motion preferences.
- Adds `assets/js/maintenance-config.js`, `assets/js/maintenance.js`, and `assets/css/maintenance.css`.
- Updates `index.html`, `package.json`, `scripts/validate.mjs`, and `README.md`.
- Runs the complete repository quality checks before deployment.

#### Turn maintenance mode on or off

Open `assets/js/maintenance-config.js` and change:

```js
enabled: false
```

to:

```js
enabled: true
```

Change it back to `false` when maintenance is complete. The title, message, status, and expected-return text can also be edited in the same file.

For a temporary preview without enabling it for everyone, open the website with:

```text
?maintenance-preview=1
```

This read-only mode prevents accidental browser-side edits. It is not authentication or server-side access control.

### Project Card Summary V3

The compact Project List summary now keeps category and deadline information fully readable.

Changes:

- Keeps **Category** or **Categories** on one line.
- Uses singular or plural wording based on the category count.
- Gives the Deadline cell more horizontal space.
- Shows the complete deadline date without truncation or an ellipsis.
- Keeps the days-left or overdue status below the full date.
- On small mobile screens, the Deadline cell moves to a full-width second row.
- Preserves the compact card, whole-card click, touch, Enter, and Space behavior.
- Updated `assets/js/app.js`, `assets/css/styles.css`, `index.html`, and `README.md`.
- Runs the full repository quality checks before deployment.

### Project Card Compact Summary V2

The Project Lists summary cards now use a shorter and more readable information row.

Changes:

- Replaced the large **Quantity** summary cell with **Area Size**.
- Displays **Area Size, Categories, and Deadline** in three compact cells.
- Reduced cell height, spacing, padding, and typography.
- Preserved the whole-card click, touch, Enter, and Space interaction.
- Preserved all tools inside the Project Detail page.
- Updated `assets/js/app.js`, `assets/css/styles.css`, `index.html`, and `README.md`.
- Runs the complete repository quality checks before deployment.

### Project List Card Cleanup V1

The Project Lists page now uses cleaner summary cards without the crowded action-button row.

Changes:

- Removed **Open list**, **Add plants**, **Quotation**, **BOQ**, and **Costing** buttons from each Project List summary card.
- Made the entire project card open the selected project.
- Added keyboard access using **Enter** or **Space** while the card is focused.
- Kept project tools inside the Project Detail page, where they are easier to organize and use.
- Preserved Quotation, BOQ, Costing Suite, Add Plant, Edit Project, and View Schedule functionality.
- Updated `assets/js/app.js`, `assets/css/styles.css`, `index.html`, and `README.md`.
- The deployment runs `npm run quality` before pushing to `main`.

- Node.js 20 or newer for repository validation only

The project does not use a frontend framework, package dependency, TypeScript, or generated build output.

## Important Data Note

Plant edits, project records, quotation drafts, BOQ drafts, and costing records created inside the live website are stored in the browser using **local storage**.

This means:

- Changes remain on the same browser and device.
- Changes do not automatically update the GitHub repository.
- Changes do not automatically appear on another computer or phone.
- Clearing browser data may remove locally saved records.
- Use the available export tools regularly to keep backups.

## Local Validation

The project uses dependency-free Node.js checks so repository updates can be verified consistently.

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run check
npm run audit
npm run quality
```

- `npm run lint` checks every website JavaScript file for syntax errors.
- `npm test` validates HTML structure, metadata, accessibility hooks, security guards, manifest data, and local asset paths.
- `npm run build` runs the same validation in static-build mode.
- `npm run check` runs JavaScript syntax checks and the standard validation.
- `npm run audit` reports static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, script-loading, and image-loading metrics.
- `npm run quality` runs linting, tests, build validation, and the static audit.
- A TypeScript check is not applicable because the repository contains no TypeScript source or configuration.
- GitHub Pages serves the repository files directly.

## Quality Review Notes

- The website intentionally remains a dependency-free static application.
- Quotation, BOQ, Costing, plant records, and project data continue using the existing browser `localStorage` keys.
- The repository review preserved the existing visual direction and workflows.
- Search indexing remains disabled because this is an internal company tool.
- Real Core Web Vitals should be measured against the deployed website using Lighthouse or WebPageTest.
- The validation scripts provide static checks but do not replace manual browser testing.

## Privacy and Search Indexing

This is an internal company tool published on a public GitHub Pages URL.

The page metadata and `robots.txt` ask search engines not to index or archive it. This discourages discovery but does not provide authentication or access control. Anyone with the public URL may still open the website.

## Troubleshooting

### A new feature is missing

- Wait for the latest GitHub Pages deployment to finish.
- Confirm that the latest commit is on the `main` branch.
- Perform a hard refresh.
- Reopen the affected page or project tool.

### Website Checks fail

1. Open the failed workflow in the **Actions** tab.
2. Expand the failed step.
3. Read the exact validation message.
4. Fix the reported file or template.
5. Run `npm run quality` locally.
6. Commit and push the correction.

### The website shows a 404 page

Check that:

- `index.html` is located in the repository root.
- GitHub Pages is using `main` and `/ (root)`.
- The latest Pages deployment completed successfully.
- The repository name is exactly `greenscape-plant-library`.

### The website shows an older version

Wait a few minutes after committing, then perform a hard refresh.

### Images or styles are missing

Confirm that the full `assets` folder was uploaded and that file names and folder paths were not changed.

### Saved records disappeared

The website stores user-created records in the browser. Check whether browser data was cleared or whether the website was opened on another device or browser.

## Project Status

The website is actively maintained and updated as the Greenscape plant database, landscape workflow, project documentation, quotation, BOQ, and costing tools develop.
